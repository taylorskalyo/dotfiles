Dotfiles
========
This repository contains many of my personal dotfiles. It is inspired by Michael 
Smalley's [dotfile repo](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles).

Scripts
-------
I've included two scripts that make managing my dotfiles easier, `install.sh` and 
`add.sh`.

    $ ~/dotfiles/install.sh
`install.sh` symlinks all of the files located within the `dotfiles` directory into the 
user's home directory. If a file already exists, it will be backed up to ~/dotfiles_old.

    $ ~/dotfiles/add.sh [filenames]
`add.sh` is intended to be run from the user's home directory. It takes in one or more 
filenames as parameters and moves the files from the home folder to the `dotfiles` 
directory and symlinks them to the user's home folder.
